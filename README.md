# Windowbuilder Images and SVGs

This repository contains all icons in SVG and PNG format that are used by the
WindowBuilder project.

## How To Build

The PNG images are generated using Inkscape. Each image is stored in both a
normal resolution (96DPI) and a high resolution (192). Due to the small size of
the images, anti-aliasing should be disabled, when possible.

For an example on how to convert the images, see (build.sh)[/build.sh].
