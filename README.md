# WindowBuilder Images and SVGs

This repository contains all icons in SVG and PNG format that are used by the
WindowBuilder project.

## How To Build

The PNG images are generated using Inkscape. Each image is stored in both a
normal resolution (96DPI) and a high resolution (192).

In order to convert all SVGs to PNGs, simply run (build.sh)[/build.sh] from the root directory.
